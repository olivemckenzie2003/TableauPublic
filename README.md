Citbike

8 Citibike CSV files were used in the company analysis

"JC-202001-citibike-tripdata.csv" "C-202206-citibike-tripdata.csv" "JC-202207-citibike-tripdata.csv" "C-202208-citibike-tripdata.csv" "JC-202211-citibike-tripdata.csv" "JC-202212-itibike-tripdata.csv" "JC-202301-itibike-tripdata.csv" "JC-202302-itibike-tripdata.csv"

Some python code was written "TimeDiff.ipynb" to find the difference between trip start time and end time and this code then populated a file called "JC-202001-citibike-BikeIDSumMins.csv" which contain two columns. One for the total time in minutes a bike is used throughout January 2020 and the other column is the bikeID. This file was then used in tableau for a visulisation

Distanced travel was calculated within tableau workbook

Visualisations were performed with tableau workbook to answer questions of the assignment

One story board, two Dash boards were created

Due Tableau crashing frequently a number of Tableau workbooks were created

A brief final report of Citibike's perforamance has been written "Citibike Brirf Report4.pdf"

latitude and longitude were used for the zip code on the static map

An attempt was made to answer all the following questions in the form of tables, tableau visualisations and a report.

Questions From the Citi Bike assignment

How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?

By what percentage has total ridership grown?

How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?

What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?

Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

How does the average trip duration change by age?

What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?

Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.

Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:

Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
